You have to create a app with following features:
- There are two pages/components of the App.
- Component-1 is the product list containing product name, description, price, product image and quantity selector.
- When a user increases the quantity using the plus(+) button or decreases using the Minus(-) for any product the total price gets updated at the bottom of the page.
 - Minimum quantity should not be below zero (0).

 - Component-2 is the summary of the products for which the quantity is more than zero.
 - When "View" is clicked in the component-1, component-2 displays and component-1 gets hidden.
 - When the "Back" button is clicked in the component-2, component-1 displays and component-2 gets hidden. So at any time only one page/component will be there on the screen.
 
 - When the Cross(X) button is clicked in component-2 for a product, that product gets removed from the list. And when going back to component-1 the quantity will be zero(0) for that product. Total price gets updated accordingly.
 - Do not waste time designing or styling the test app, it is already provided in 'template.html'. The Functionality(coding) part will be checked most.

Note:

1. Vegetable images in the 'images' folder are for use as assets in the app.
2. 'template.html' file contains design HTML template and CSS for the app, You can use them in your test-app.
